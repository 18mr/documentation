This file is a step-by-step guide to setting up an Action Network petition on the new stack. You'll use some skills from other files in the documentation, but this can also be a stand-alone walkthrough for creating a petition.

## Step One: Load It!

Most of the content displayed on petition pages on http://action.18mr.org is actually drawn directly from [Action Network](http://actionnetwork.org). [Go create an action](https://github.com/18mr/documentation/blob/master/action-network.md).

Once you've set up, you're ready to create a post to house it. Be sure to add relevant tags to the action. This will help us track the kinds of campaigns and issue areas that matter the most to our members in the long-term.

## Step Two: Prep It!

Before you drop your widget into a new post, you need to create a new post. There are a few essential steps you need to take before you get started.

### Prepare Your Local Clone

Check out the [guide for keeping your files up-to-date](https://github.com/18mr/documentation/blob/master/sync-your-fork.md) to learn how. Make sure your _local version_ of the website is up-to-date, not just the repository on your personal GitHub account.

### Place a Featured Image in the Directory

Featured images should __aspect ratio of 4:3__ and they should be added to the directory /static/images/featured.

### Create a New File

Open up your favorite text editor and create a new document. Save it as a .md file in the _posts directory on your hard drive's copy of the website. _posts all have a similar file naming convention: YEAR-MO-DA-unique-slug.md.

### Create Front Matter

YAML Front Matter is how Jekyll knows how to treat the files you add to the website. Every post and page in Jekyll needs Front Matter. Start with triple dashes at the beginning and end of your Front Matter.

    ---
    layout: petition-page
    title: "Edward Blum: We Won't Be Used For Your Racist Agenda"
    permalink: /blockblum/
    category: campaigns
    featured-image: '/static/images/featured/blum.png'
    blurb: "Edward Blum is on a mission to dismantle affirmative action. And he's using AAPIs to do it."
    description: "Despite his best efforts, Asian Americans are refusing to be a part of Blumâ€™s racist, anti-affirmative action agenda. The days of divide and conquer are over!"
    ---
  
A basic description of each piece of metadata follows:

+ 'layout' describes which template we will be using. "petition-page" is the default petition page template.
+ 'title' is the page title that will be displayed in the browser. It should be the same as the petition title you entered in Action Network
+ 'permalink' describes the url for the page. Make it descriptive and unique.
+ 'category' indicates that you are creating a post in the "campaigns" category. This is important for the future, as we make a full transition to Jekyll and multiple categories of posts will be posted to the same site.
+ 'featured-image' should be the relative path to the featured image you added to the /featured/ directory.
+ 'blurb' is the tiny snippet of text that will appear on the index of campaigns at action.18mr.org
+ 'description' is the Facebook Open Graph share text that you would like shared. This should be the same as in the Action Network share settings.

## Step Three: Embed It!

Back in Action Network, you can grab the code to embed the petition as a widget in your new post by clicking "edit" on the petition on the 18MR organizational dashboard. You'll see a sidebar that prompts you to embed the petition, with a mess of code and a button that says "Options+" beneath it. Before you copy and paste that code into your new page, make sure that you have the proper options set up: enter "100%" into the custom width field; "Layout Styles Only"; and "Full Layout," as illustrated below.

I'm a big fan of breaking up the code a little so it's easier for humans to read if something goes wrong, usually into four lines like this:

    <link href='https://actionnetwork.org/css/style-embed-whitelabel.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' />
    <script>window.yepnope || document.write('<script src="https://actionnetwork.org/assets/yepnope154-min.js"><\/script>');</script>
    <script src='https://actionnetwork.org/widgets/v2/petition/petition-name?format=js&source=widget&style=full'></script>
    <div id='can-petition-area-petition-name' style='width: 100%'><!-- this div is the target for our HTML insertion --></div>

## Step Four: Customize Widget Contents

Let's say you're making a [call-in campaign](https://github.com/18mr/documentation/blob/master/call-tool.md) and you want to be able to change the default text in the widget. While you can't do it from Action Network, once you've embedded the widget, you can use a little Javascript to alter the text inside. First, set up the snippet on your petition page like this:

    <script>
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $('#can-petition-area-petition-name').on('can_embed_loaded', function() {
        	
            });
        });
    </script>
    
Instead of `#can-petition-area-petition-name`, use the slug that you find in your own embed code from Step Three.

Now, in the middle of that you can drop some little bits of code that select elements inside the widget and change them around. If you open up your local version of the website, and inspect an element, you can learn how to refer to that element. Here are the three basic ways you can refer to elements, with some examples of how you might use them.

### Get Elements by Name

Some elements have a "name." A great example of this is the submit button, which usually reads "Add Your Name." That doesn't make sense if the ask is to call your Senator, so you can use the following snippet to select the "commit" button by name and change the text:

    document.getElementsByName("commit")[0].value = "Call Now";

### Select Elements Using CSS

If an element has an easily identifiable CSS label, you can use that as well. Instead of the default "Sign This Petition," you may want visitors to read a more generic phrase, like "Take Action." If you inspect that text on your local site, you'll see that it's surrounded by `<h4>` and inside a `div` called `.action_sidebar`. So you'd select it and then change the text to "Take Action," like so:
    
    $(".action_sidebar h4").text("Take Action");

### Select Elements by Class Name

If there's _just_ a class name, and you want to select a particular _part_ of the text inside that class, you may need to use the following, longer snippet. In this example, instead of "Signatures Collected" at the top of the goal bar, you want the units we're tracking to be "Calls Completed."

    var str = document.getElementsByClassName("action_status_running_total")[0].innerHTML;
    
Says that we're defining a variable called `str` by grabbing the HTML contents of `.action_status_running_total`.
    
    var txt = str.replace("Signatures Collected", "Calls Completed");

Says that we're defining a variable called `txt` by swapping the string of characters "Signatures Collected" for the string of characters "Calls Completed."

    document.getElementsByClassName("action_status_running_total")[0].innerHTML = txt;
    
Says that we're going into the HTML document, getting the contents of `.action_status_running_total` and finding and replacing the strings we defined in the variable `txt`.

All together, this should look like this. 

    <script>
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $('#can-petition-area-petition-name').on('can_embed_loaded', function() {
                document.getElementsByName("commit")[0].value = "Call Now";
                $(".action_sidebar h4").text("Take Action");
                var str = document.getElementsByClassName("action_status_running_total")[0].innerHTML;
                var txt = str.replace("Signatures Collected", "Calls Completed");
                document.getElementsByClassName("action_status_running_total")[0].innerHTML = txt;
            });
        });
    </script>
