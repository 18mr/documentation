Our action and email platform, Action Network, is a pretty flexible tool. One of the best things about it is it's easy to set up a petition, quickly. They embed anywhere and it's easy to collaborate both inside and outside the organization.

First, pick your action type. Most petitions you'll make will be of the "petition" type.

Log into [Action Network](https://actionnetwork.org) and make sure you're administering the 18MR.org group. You'll be able to tell because there will be an action history and 18MR.org will feature prominently in the header. Scroll down and find the "Create a Sponsored Action" box on the righthand side. Pick "Petition."

## Step One: Create Your Petition

When you create a new petition, there are three things you should come prepared with:

1. "Title of your petition."
2. "Banner image."
3. "Why is this important?"

These map to areas that are published in your final product like this:

Save this, and you don't have to edit anything on the second screen.

## Step One Point Five: Adding Custom Fields

If you want to collect a custom piece of data from members, such as a phone number, you can do this in the menu on the right that looks like this.

## Step Two: Tags for Segmenting

## Step Three: Response Options

## Step Four: Sharing Options

Now you're ready to [embed that puppy in a page for publishing on action.18mr.org](https://github.com/18mr/documentation/blob/master/embed-an.md)!
