If something goes wrong, here are some helpful hints.

## With GitHub

### I forgot to sync and GitHub won't let me automatically merge!

You will probably need to get Tech to take care of this: versions will have to be reconciled in the command line.

## With Jekyll

### My Markdown isn't working!

A common problem with Markdown is that you have to make a full line break before each new thing. For instance, if you have some explanatory text before a list, this won't work:

    Explanatory text.
    + item one
    + item two
    
But this will:

    Explanatory text.
    
    + item one
    + item two

## With Action Network

## Can't Figure It Out?

[Submit a detailed issue and Tech will see if they can replicate, explain, and fix it](https://github.com/18mr/documentation/issues/new).
