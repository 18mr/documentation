Once a pull request has been processed or new code has been added to the main repository, you want to update yours so you have the most current content to work with. Basically, you're going to create and merge your own pull request from the master into your own repository.

Navigate to the fork in your _personal_ GitHub account (not the organizational one).

If you can update from the master, organizational trunk, the button that says "Update from 18mr/the-project" will be clickable in the GitHub application.

Click it and, voila! Your local version will be all up-to-date.

If you aren't making straightforward changes, you'll have to settle the differences between those changes on the command line. Unless you _want_ to learn the Git command line, we've set this up so you can avoid it by following a couple simple conventions. If you have problems anywhere along the way, let tech know.
