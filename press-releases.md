Press releases operate much the same as blog posts on the main website. There are a couple unique features of press releases that are worth noting here.

## Press Release Template

There's a layout called `release` that you should use for all press releases. It's a full-width template that also includes social sharing buttons.

## Print/PDF Distribution Releases

In general, when you create a press release, you should make a version on the website, where contact information is already handled. If you're sending a release out to our press contacts, draft and send it in an email (no attachment). This makes it more likely that a recipient will open and read it.

Contact information on the press release should be your @18millionrising.org email address and (510) 394-2848 as the phone number. Before you send out the release, go to [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com) to make sure the phone number is linked to a number you can answer. Be sure to let other team members know so they won't be surprised by Google Voice calls!
