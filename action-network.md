Our action and email platform, Action Network, is a pretty flexible tool. One of the best things about it is it's easy to set up a petition, quickly. They embed anywhere and it's easy to collaborate both inside and outside the organization.

First, pick your action type. Most petitions you'll make will be of the "petition" type.

Log into [Action Network](https://actionnetwork.org) and make sure you're administering the 18MR.org group. You'll be able to tell because there will be an action history and 18MR.org will feature prominently in the header. Scroll down and find the "Create a Sponsored Action" box on the righthand side. Pick "Petition."

## Step One: Create Your Petition

When you create a new petition, there are three things you should come prepared with:

1. "Title of your petition."
2. "Banner image."
3. "Why is this important?"

These map to areas that are published in your final product like this:

Save this, and you don't have to edit anything on the second screen.

## Step One Point Five: Adding Custom Fields

If you want to collect a custom piece of data from members, such as a phone number, you can do this in the menu on the right that looks like this.

If you click "Add Or Edit Additional Form Questions," you'll get a slightly more user-friendly version. If you click "Add Custom Form HTML," you'll get a field to enter some HTML. This is useful for customizing the form beyond adding a field.

Something you'll have to keep in mind, no matter which method you use, is to keep your data labels clean. There are already some custom data labels in our Action Network database, and you can find a [list of current custom data labels here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cQ0qwEba8qWcM4ChPHNTfyJp_LOAR3bze5M0OEM5yBU/edit#gid=0).

## Step Two: Tags for Segmenting

Once you've saved your petition, you'll want to add tags. The principle of tag-writing is to place your petition in a broad category with other petitions for rapid segmenting. When a member signs a petition tagged "Immigration" the "Immigration" tag will also be added to their profile. We now know this is something they care about, and can email them with a future "Immigration" themed petition.

We also tag users with partner names, even if we create an opt-in. This helps us track which partners produce results, and what kind of results they produce. In the example below, the petition was developed with Gazillion Adoptees, so a tag was created to identify that partnership.

The button to find and add tags is at the top of the management page. If you don't find a tag in the menu, you can add a tag by opening the "Start Organizing" dropdown and picking "tags." This will also show you a list of existing tags.

## Step Three: After Action Steps

For some reason, in Action Network, you need to publish your petition in order to get to editing the response and sharing options. They are tabs available when you scroll down on the management screen.

### Response Options

In the "Response Options" tab, you'll want to customize the email members receive when they successfully add their name to the petition.

The default settings provide you with some basics, but be sure to do the following:

1. Add your name to the from field, so it reads as "Your Name, 18MillionRising.org"
2. Write some evocative language. The default text is pretty boring, to be honest.
3. Add your name to the sign off as well.

### Sharing Options

Now, click over to the "Sharing Options" tab. Here you will enter the defaults for after-action sharing to Twitter, Facebook, and via email.

There are a few key things to change here:

1. For Facebook, shorten the description. The default is your entire petition text; Facebook displays about 160 words.
2. For Twitter, customize the Tweet. If possible, tag @18millionrising to make it easier for us to periodically retweet mentions of campaigns.
3. For Email a Friend, shorten the description of the campaign to an elevator pitch. You may include additional information about the campaign, but think about what the quick ask is, and why someone would want to sign your petition. Make sure the link is toward the top of the sample email.
4. Change the direct link to the slug of your [petition page](https://github.com/18mr/documentation/blob/master/embed-an.md). You'll want to make sure all the links in the above sections are also this slug, otherwise people will be directed to the default, Action Network branded petition instead of our pretty 18MR.org branded petition on our website.

Save that goodness, and you're ready to [embed that petition in a page for publishing on action.18mr.org](https://github.com/18mr/documentation/blob/master/embed-an.md)!
