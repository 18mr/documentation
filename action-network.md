Our action and email platform, Action Network, is a pretty flexible tool. One of the best things about it is it's easy to set up a petition, quickly. They embed anywhere and it's easy to collaborate both inside and outside the organization.

First, pick your action type. Most petitions you'll make will be of the "petition" type.

Log into [Action Network](https://actionnetwork.org) and make sure you're administering the 18MR.org group. You'll be able to tell because there will be an action history and 18MR.org will feature prominently in the header. Scroll down and find the "Create a Sponsored Action" box on the righthand side. Pick "Petition."

## Step One: Create Your Petition

When you create a new petition, there are three things you should come prepared with:

1. "Title of your petition."
2. "Banner image."
3. "Why is this important?"

These map to areas that are published in your final product like this:

Save this, and you don't have to edit anything on the second screen.

## Step One Point Five: Adding Custom Fields

If you want to collect a custom piece of data from members, such as a phone number, you can do this in the menu on the right that looks like this.

If you click "Add Or Edit Additional Form Questions," you'll get a slightly more user-friendly version. If you click "Add Custom Form HTML," you'll get a field to enter some HTML. This is useful for customizing the form beyond adding a field.

Something you'll have to keep in mind, no matter which method you use, is to keep your data labels clean. There are already some custom data labels in our Action Network database, and you can find a [list of current custom data labels here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cQ0qwEba8qWcM4ChPHNTfyJp_LOAR3bze5M0OEM5yBU/edit#gid=0).

## Step Two: Tags for Segmenting

Once you've saved your petition, you'll want to add tags. The principle of tag-writing is to place your petition in a broad category with other petitions for rapid segmenting. When a member signs a petition tagged "Immigration" the "Immigration" tag will also be added to their profile. We now know this is something they care about, and can email them with a future "Immigration" themed petition.

We also tag users with partner names, even if we create an opt-in. This helps us track which partners produce results, and what kind of results they produce. In the example below, the petition was developed with Gazillion Adoptees, so a tag was created to identify that partnership.

The button to find and add tags is at the top of the management page. If you don't find a tag in the menu, you can add a tag by opening the "Start Organizing" dropdown and picking "tags." This will also show you a list of existing tags.
