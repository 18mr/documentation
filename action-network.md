This file is a step-by-step guide to setting up an Action Network petition on the new stack. You'll use some skills from other files in the documentation, but this can also be a stand-alone walkthrough for creating a petition.

## Step One: Load It!

Most of the content displayed on petition pages on http://action.18mr.org is actually drawn directly from [Action Network](http://actionnetwork.org). When you're logged in, go create an action. Here's a quick guide to what shows up where when it gets translated into a post:

1. "Title of your petition."
2. "Banner image."
3. "Why is this important?"

Once you've saved this stuff, as well as filling in the social/sharing copy and the delivery copy, you're ready to create a post to house it. Be sure to add relevant tags to the action. This will help us track the kinds of campaigns and issue areas that matter the most to our members in the long-term.

## Step Two: Prep It!

Before you drop your widget into a new post, you need to create a new post. 

## Step Three: Embed It!

Back in Action Network, you can grab the code to embed the petition as a widget in your new post by clicking "edit" on the petition on the 18MR organizational dashboard. You'll see a sidebar that prompts you to embed the petition, with a mess of code and a button that says "Options+" beneath it. Before you copy and paste that code into your new page, make sure that you have the proper options set up:
