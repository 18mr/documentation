Got some great content to put on the main site? Great.

If you haven't already, [set up Jekyll locally](https://github.com/18mr/documentation/blob/master/local-site.md) and get a clone of _18mr_ onto your local machine.

Start by [syncing the local version of the site](https://github.com/18mr/documentation/blob/master/sync-your-fork.md) you have from the trunk.

It also is helpful to [have a version of the site running](https://github.com/18mr/documentation/blob/master/local-site.md#step-three-run-it) so you can preview your changes in real-time.

## Create a New Post

As you may have noticed in the directory setup in GitHub, posts go in a directory contained in their category. This is to ensure that category pages are generated properly in Jekyll: category pages are not part of the feature set that Jekyll ships with, so this is a bit of a hack, with a plugin, to ensure that these come out pretty (and paginated!) on the final site.

### How to Pick a Category

_Communities_ posts illuminate the important work of local communities for racial justice. They may explore what it means to be a community, how we identify who are community is, or a unique victory or experience of a community.

_Culture_ posts deal with how we interact with all kinds of culture, whether it's television and movies or fine art. They could be talking about casting choices or interrogating how advertising plays a role in racialization. Or they could be lifting up art made by members of our community that offer an alternative viewpoint.

_Ideas_ posts deal in concepts. They're the theoretical underpinning for our work, and posts that challenge us to think a little harder or push the envelope on how we understand the world around us.

_Identities_ posts consider all the ways in which people are AAPIs, generally from a first-person perspective. They're about both who we are and how we arrived there, personally and politically.

### Metadata

Now that you've chosen a category, fire up your text editor. The first thing you'll do is add metadata, or [Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) which tells Jekyll how to understand the file, and pulls in necessary elements like thumbnail images, page layouts, and more.

![example front matter](https://github.com/18mr/documentation/blob/master/images/post.PNG)

Your completed Front Matter should have the following elements to be parsed correctly:

1. __Layout__: this should match the file name of a layout in the _layouts directory.
2. __Title__: in quotes, so as not to break Jekyll, your full title. If you need to use a quote, use a single quote, and use double quotes for the outside.
3. __Category__: this should match the directory you're saving your file in.
4. __Author__: whoever wrote the post. _Currently not mapped to Author files._
5. __Featured Image__: the thumbnail you'd like to appear on the main website, as well as in Facebook shares. Images should follow directory conventions (store your featured image in _/static/images/featured/_ and name the file after the blog post).
6. __Featured Alt-text__: write a robust description of your image. This is for the benefit of people using screen readers to understand the site, and an important accessibility element.
7. __Tweet__: the text of the sample Tweet generated by the site for visitors to share via their personal account.
8. __Facebook__: the blurb added below the title on a Facebook share of the post.
9. __Blurb__: the preview text featured on the main site, as well as category index pages. This can be as long as you want, but it _will_ be automatically truncated for you, so...
10. __Permalink__: the URL that will show up when your post is online. Should be formatted with "/YEAR/MO/the-post-title.html".
10. Finally, all this goodness needs to be enclosed in a set of triple dashes, so Jekyll knows it's looking at Front Matter.

### Write and Format

Paste your text into the body of the file, below the second line of triple dashes. Files here are written in [_Markdown_](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), which is a handy markup language halfway between HTML and a WYSIWYG editor. This solves the age-old problem that has faced WYSIWYG editor users, where what you see is sometimes not what you get, without requiring you to write and format an entire document in HTML.

## Adding Images

In addition to your featured image, which you should go ahead and dump in the featured images directory (located at _/static/images/featured_) and named in the same format as your blog post, you can add additional images by creating a directory in _/static/images/blog_. You'll notice that, again, directories in _/static/images/blog_ are named in much the same way featured images and blog post files are.

Markdown has syntax for images, which looks a bit like this:

    ![Your alt-text for screen readers goes here](/static/images/blog/2016-03-09-creating-a-new-post/this.jpg)
    
If you want to do anything fancier (for instance, give your image some additional formatting) you can also use HTML in a Markdown document and Jekyll will parse it, no big deal.
  
## Styles and Format 

Is there an awesome snippet of text you want to highlight? Make a pretty pull quote by placing "> ##" before a line of text. 

If you have an author bio to include, place it at the end of the post, beneath a horizontal line ("<HR>"), and italicize. 

## Save Your Post

As indicated above, there's a right way to name your final product. It should match the name of your featured image as well as any additional image directory you may have created. In the category _posts_ directory you choose, save your document with this filename format:

    YEAR-MO-DA-your-new-blog-post.md

This will ensure Jekyll generates the page properly.

## Check Your Work

Go ahead and open up your web browser and navigate to the _localhost_ URL specified by Jekyll when you fired up the server emulator. If you did everything right, your blog post should be there looking snazzy on the homepage. 

If everything looks good, it's time to [commit and create a pull request](https://github.com/18mr/documentation/blob/master/commit-pullrequest.md).
