### How do you override a link generated by Action Network? (3/15/2016)

Due to browser encoding, some special character encoding may break a link in an Action Network email. To override this, you have two options:

1. Shorten the link using bit.ly. Check the 1Password vault for our account.
2. Double-encode the character. If you, for instance, need to encode a + sign in your URL, you would normally write %20 to encode it. To double-encode it, begin by encoding a %. Instead of %20, you'd write %2520.
